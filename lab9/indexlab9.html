	<h3>Problems</h3>
	<p>We had to experiment to get our buttons to show up on the site. It took me a really long time to work around getting the button to even show up on the site in the first place. I had to re-mess with each section of code such as my divs and css structure in order to finally get them to appear on my site. I also don't know if I should cry or laugh because I ended up with some wacko polka dots and it took me a minute to figure out why the heck that happened but then once I knew it was from a dotted border I left it because it was actually just part of the plot at this point. WELP.</p>
