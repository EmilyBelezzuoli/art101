		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We have previously debugged or re-worked labs when needed so we didn't have a ton to mess with this time. Mainly looking over the css to make sure everything was displaying as intended. For example, sometimes the challenge box was not presented properly on the page with the same box structure as the problems and results. I had a end div at the start instead of a opening div for the class on my challenge section of my html for a few labs so it was an easy fix once identified!
			fixed for 11, 12, and 13
