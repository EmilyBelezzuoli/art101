		    <h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> My main problem was struggling to comprehend the code thanks to my incredible negative sleep schduele. But one must perservere! Ayoooo. Coding wise it wasn't too bad because I had already added and rearanged images for lab 2! </p>

		    <h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p> I put whatever remaining energy I had into this assignemnt. I have added additional index.html files for past labs and have experience with video film organization so that wasn't a concern for me. I think I could continue to work more on image positioning and later work to better color my sight. I am definitely interesting in the visual abilites and am excited to see where my learning takes me! </p>
