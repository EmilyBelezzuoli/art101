		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Luckily for this lab, we had previous experience through class examples and notes material that was able to assist us when issues arose. I tried to be a bit more careful as I have been getting a couple small- but annoying issues for the last couple labs without fully knowing why. Working with my partner we were able to get through the lab!</p>
