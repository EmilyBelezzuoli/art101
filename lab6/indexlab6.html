    <h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
	    <div class="minor-section">

	<h2>Subject</h2>
	<p> For Lab 6 we worked to explore JS and worked with arrays and objects. </p>

		    <h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> A main problem was working to understand the initial JS and making sure to add all of the right code within the line. For exmaple, not forgetting things such as an equals sign.</p>

		    <h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p> The JS became straightforwards beyound small errors that were a little annoying to decode at times as well as working to make the JS appear on the site. I really struggled to get the code to show up on my site. That's definitely been the most time consuming part recently. It's usually just a couple little errors but they can be so difficult to discover, espeically with being so new to coding which can be frustrtaing but it is also something that I am excited to become stronger at as I continue to understand code. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> -here they are- </p>
