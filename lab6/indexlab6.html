    <h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
	    <div class="minor-section">

	<h2>Subject</h2>
	<p> For Lab 6 we worked to explore JS and worked with arrays and objects. </p>

		    <h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> A main problem was working to understand the initial JS and making sure to add all of the right code within the line. For exmaple, not forgetting things such as an equals sign.</p>

		    <h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p> The JS became straightforwards beyound small errors that were a little annoying to decode at times as well as working to make the JS appear on the site. I had trouble remebering to add the + signs to my code and to include spaces within the console.log. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> UMM AHHHH IDEK WHY OR HOW ITS BROKE SO I WILL FIX IT I PROMOSE! </p>
