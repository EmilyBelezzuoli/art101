    <h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
	    <div class="minor-section">

	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p> For Lab 7 we worked to explore JS and worked with JS fucntions.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
		    <h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>We had to experiment to get code to show up on the site. Additionally, referencing notes and class material to try the bonus.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
		    <h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You are looking at function that was created and my refleection of the bonus tasks.</p>
		</div>


        <div class="minor-section">
        	<h2>Script Output</h2>
            <script src="../lab7/js/lab7.js"></script>
			<p>I tired bonus five which took a lot of time. For bonus task 5, I worked to make it so window.prompt () happens outside my function, using the name as a parameter. This created the same results as the initial lab but was an alternation on how to achieve such results. This took a lot of trial and error as although it was mentioned in class I often felt lost through using parameters with functions. I tried to reference the slides and my notes from class and eventually got it to work but there were some points where I was extremely confused. Doing this bonus task allowed me to further work with functions and to better understand how they work and how I might want to explore using them in the future.</p>
