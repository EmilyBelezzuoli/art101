	    <div class="minor-section">

	<h2>Subject</h2>
	<p> For Lab 4 we worked to explore JS and declare variables. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
		    <h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> A main problem was working to understand the initial JS and making sure to add all of the right code within the line. For exmaple, not forgetting things such as an equals sign.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
		    <h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p> The JS became straightforwards beyound small errors that were a little annoying to decode at times as well as working to make the JS appear on the site. It was interesting to start to work with variables and think about were they can go tho!</p>
