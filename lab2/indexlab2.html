        <h1>Hello World</h1>

        <p>Hello my name is Emily. I am a freshman double majoring in art and film.
            I play tennis on the club tennis team. I am an avid vivd dreamer and I
            am intertested in the concepts of perspectives in relation to time.
        </p>
        <p>My partner is Lock Tachibana. She just gave me a muffin from the dining hall and I was very grateful 
            because I had just finished tennis! Lock somehow has 3am energy between the hours of 12-3pm since returning
            from break which can only be equated to the Singapore timezone... I know that Lock works really hard 
            and I am excited to work with her this quarter! 
        </p>
